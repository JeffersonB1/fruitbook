# Fruitbook

## Description

Do you have fruit lying around? Is it about to go bad? We have the perfect website for you...

Enter Fruitbook: Input the name of a fruit and you will be presented with not only all the best nutritional information for that fruit, but you will also be shown the top eight coolest recipes the internet has to offer (along with a link to find out more information about that recipe)! You'll also be shown a picture of what your fruit looks like. The app runs entirely in the browser, and can be viewed anywhere online. It also uses the CSS framework 'Bulma' for a displaying a modern UI. It uses three server side APIs - one for retrieving a picture, one for nutritional information, and one for recipes. Finally, the app uses client side storage to keep a list of most recently visited fruits
